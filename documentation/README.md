# Documentation

Leap.js is a lightweight Node.js framework to accelerate the building of efficient and scalable server-side applications with Typescript. It is built with and fully supports [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

Under the hood, the framework makes use of Express. The framework provides a layer of abstraction over express but also exposes their APIs to the developer. This allows developers to use a wide range of third-party modules available for express.

## Prerequisites

Please make sure that [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) \(&gt;=10.x.x\) is installed on your system

## Limitations in the current release

* The Scheduler, Queue and CRUD modules only support MongoDB
* Queue only has support for RabbitMQ
